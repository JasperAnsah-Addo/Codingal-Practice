    <!--How I got to know about CODING-->
    <h2><u>How I Got To Know About Coding</u></h2>
    <p>I got to know about conding during my fifth year in primary &#128527; Mhmm, my fifth year. It was through a friend I first got to hear 
        about it.<br>
     I used to a lot of questions about it because I heard it was really interesting.
     I remember during one of our conversations he told me coding was what helped computers to work.<br><br>
     It was in Junior High School I got to know it was true. My teacher spoke a lot about it when because it was part of our curriculum. <br>
     To those who don't know I am Ghanaian and I am a teenager. Sorry for not introducing myself &#128513; <br><br>
     My name is Jasper. I know you do not know me but it's okay &#128513; I am someone who really loves coding. Yep.
     I love coding but i sometimes get lazy about it &#128517; Sometimes I just don't feel like coding but I have to 
     because I earn points for it &#128522; and I guess that is the best way to get someone to code &#128514; <br>
     You might be wondering why and how you can feel lazy about something you love. It's normal though. 
     Okay so the long and short of it is that a friend told me about it.

    <!--How did you hear about codingal-->
    <h2>Codingal...</h2>
    <p>So, codingal is an online platform that is 
        used to equip people with the necessary coding
        skills. It does't work on it's own. It is like a
        school online. There are really skilled teachers 
        that teach leareners all over the world how to code.
        I tell you, they are really good &#128522; teachers. 
        My mom introduced it to me when I was in Basic 7.
        I couldn't join because I was really busy but got 
        the time to join when I completed Basic 9.

        On the day of registration I was a bit nervous
        but I prayed to God for strength and He answered me.
        My classes have been really engaging and very fun.
        I get to learn something new everynew day &#128536;
        <mark>My coding teacher is the best.</mark><b>THE BEST.</b>
        <br> He is always on time and makes sure I enjoy and
        understand every part of the lesson. He's 
        encouraging and motivating. Inspiring and interesting.<br>
        He's Kenyan and because of that I will start my journery
        to learn Swahili.
