        <!--update on my first coding class-->
        Hello.<br><br>Please this is Jasper Ansah-Addo and I will be sharing with you how I felt about my first class with codingal on Web Development, specifically, HTML.<br><br>
     My first class was at 8:00pm on 20 September,2024.<br> I really enjoyed the class because I really understood how coding with html is like and I loved the way my teacher taught.<br> He really made me understand the class and I hope the rest of my classes will be that fun.
     <br> Thank You.
